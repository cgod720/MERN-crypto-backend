# MERN-crypto-backend

This is the backend to CryptoSphere, a full stack application that serves as a central hub 
for crypto enthusiasts. Users can use the application to find financial information about the
top 1000 coins(by market capitalization), and they can also make a watchlist to track their
favorites. There are also the latest news articles related to cryptocurrency listed on the page,
which users can click on and be redirected to those articles.

This project was built using MongoDB as the database and an Express server.
